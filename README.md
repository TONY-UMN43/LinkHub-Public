## Description
This is a Full-Stack Project that features user authentication, job postings, user feeds, and much more to mirror the LinkedIn experience. For the tech stack, React was used for the frontend client, FastAPI was used for the backend server, and PostgreSQL was used for the database. Python libraries such as Pydantic and SQLAlchemy were used to make SQL operations to the database, and create the tables in the database.  Google Gemini was used for the CSS design of this application to create a user-friendly experience where the UI of this application is able to adapt to many screen sizes. This design choice was made because it was impractical to test the UI of this project across hundreds of different screens and many different browsers.
