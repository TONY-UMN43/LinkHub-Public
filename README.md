## Description
LinkHub is a professional networking project that was inspired by LinkedIn.

The user flow for this project is that the user either creates an account or logins to an existing one, they see post on their user feed and they also have the ability to look all the jobs posted recently to last on their user feed. Google Gemini was used for the CSS design of this application to create a user-friendly experience where the UI of this application is able to run on tablets, phones, laptops, and desktops. In addition it ensures that the UI is responsive on different screen sizes. This design choice was made because it was impractical to test the UI of this project across hundreds of different screens and many different browsers.

## Project Impact
LinkHub showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack production-ready product for users.

It shows skills in every area of full-stack - building a secure backend with FastAPI, creating a PostgreSQL database to store persistent data, and developing an optimized React frontend with the help of Google Gemini.

Used real-life features such as JWT authentication, company job postings, and user feeds that fetch data from the database.

This project reflects the process of turning high-level System Design ideas into a polished program. It also reflects being able to use Google Gemini when there are technical limitations.
