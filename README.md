## Description
LinkHub is a professional networking project that was inspired by LinkedIn.

The user flow for this project is that the user either creates an account or logins to an existing one, they see post on their user feed and they also have the ability to look all the jobs posted recently to last on their user feed. Google Gemini was used for the CSS design of this application to create a user-friendly experience where the UI of this application is able to run on tablets, phones, laptops, and desktops. This design choice was made because it was impractical to test the UI of this project across hundreds of different screens and many different browsers.

## Project Goal
The goal of designing this project was to gain practical experience with software engineering and to see how real-world social media applications store data and handle features such as user authentication and user feeds. React and PostgreSQL, in particular, are used in many real-world applications such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and more. By using these real-world tools to build this project, it was a very valuable learning experience of how real-world applications work behind the scenes.
